# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
The gem of my choice was terminal-table.  I used it to output the lists in a table on the console.  Makes the lists easier to read.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I added a “reminder” list type.  
  b) I also added the ability to delete multiple list items at one time.


# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Took about 8 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Learning about the Gemfile.  It’s a great feature because almost all apps regardless of language have dependencies.  It was nice to see how elegantly Ruby handles it.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
- I added a “reminder” list type because personally I always have reminder lists myself.
- I added the ability to delete multiple list items at once.  That is also a very useful feature.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I need deeper understanding of concepts.
